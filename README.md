Project "Myrra" is a longlasting attempt to make an ambitious one-man-made indie game with a female cat as a protagonist. 
The core mechanics of this game are related to emotional state of a creature. Emotion is defined by a simple PAD-like color-defined model. It affects attacks, skills, stats, influencing other creatures. 
Emotion is fed by a map of reactions on different "reasonable" events. This map (in case of the player character) can be modified by experience points, yielding unique temper and style of walking through.
Gameplay activities include exploring a world of mostly natural appearance (its not yet defined whether it will be fully open) in 1st and 3rd person mode, puzzles, real time fights and survival elements, all this with abundant usage of physics. 
The game is still at early stages of development and has a murky future due to technical difficulties, shortage of time, and 2022.

This version is built with Unreal Engine 5.

This repository does not include much of the "Content" folder with Unreal Engine assets, as well as rough resources. Anyway there is no free space for all content made to date.
Eventually it will be added as a reference
