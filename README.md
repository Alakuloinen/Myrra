Project "Myrra" is a longlasting attempt to make a one-man-made indie game with a female cat as a protagonist. 
The gameplay includes exploring 3D world (its not yet defined whether it will be fully open) in 1st and 3rd person mode,
puzzles, real time fights and survival elements, all this with bundant usage of the physics engine. 
Planned as an ambitious Action/RPG, the game is still at early stages of development due to technical difficulties, shortage of time and human resources.

The current version is built with Unreal Engine 4.27

This repository does not include the "Content" folder with Unreal Engine assets, as well as rough resources. Anyway there is no free space for all content made to date.
Eventually will be added as a reference
